# **Overview**

The Jupyter Notebook consists of various implementations of Natural Language processing ML models

The processes covered in the ML pipeline:

* TfidVectorize 
* GloVe vectorization
* Logistic Regression 
* Support Vector machines
* Recurrent Neural networks - Vanilla and Bidirectional LTSM with learning rate modifiers.

**Tensorflow Backend** has been used with Keras support.
