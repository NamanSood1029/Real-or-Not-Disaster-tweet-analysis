# Real or Not ? Tweet Classification

Submission for the Kaggle Natural language processing competition for a tweet dataset labelled as **Real or Fake disasters**. The folder consists of the submission attempt summary and workflow (without hyperparameter tuning)

The respective Jupyter notebook goes through the process of data acquisition, preprocessing, feature modelling, data cleaning and the machine learning pipeline followed. 

**Tensorflow Backend** along with Keras has been used. The notebook explores various NLP techniques such as vectorization, recurrent neural networks (vanilla and bidirectional LSTM) and vanilla classification with logistic regression, support vector machines etc.

**Challenge:**

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.
